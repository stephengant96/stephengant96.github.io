  abstract = {Accurate prediction of electronic and optical excitations in van der Waals (vdW) materials is a long-standing challenge for density functional theory. The recent Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional has proven successful in non-empirical determination of electronic band gaps and optical absorption spectra for covalent and ionic crystals. However, for vdW materials the tuning of the material- and structure-dependent functional parameters has only been attained semi-empirically. Here, we present a non-empirical WOT-SRSH approach applicable to vdW materials, with the optimal functional parameters transferable between monolayer and bulk. We apply this methodology to prototypical vdW materials: black phosphorus, molybdenum disulfide, and hexagonal boron nitride (in the latter case including zero-point renormalization). We show that the WOT-SRSH approach consistently achieves accuracy levels comparable to experiments and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations for band structures and optical absorption spectra, both on its own and as an optimal starting point for MBPT calculations.},

WOT-SRSH functionals have been shown to yield highly accurate fundamental band gaps, band structures, and optical spectra for bulk and 2D semiconductors and insulators. Our workflow automatically and efficiently determines the WOT-SRSH functional parameters for a given crystal structure and composition, approximately enforcing the correct screened long-range Coulomb interaction and an ionization potential ansatz. In contrast to previous manual tuning approaches, our tuning procedure relies on a new search algorithm that only requires a few hybrid functional calculations with minimal user input. We demonstrate our workflow on 23 previously studied semiconductors and insulators, reporting the same high level of accuracy. By automating the tuning process and improving its computational efficiency, the approach outlined here enables applications of the WOT-SRSH functional to compute spectroscopic and optoelectronic properties for a wide range of materials.},

Here, we investigate the accuracy of the recently developed Wannier-localized optimally tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional as a generalized Kohn-Sham starting point for single-shot GW (G0W0) calculations for a range of semiconductors and insulators. Comparison to calculations based on well-established functionals, namely, PBE, PBE0, and HSE, as well as to self-consistent GW schemes and to experiment, shows that band gaps computed via G0W0@WOT-SRSH have a level of precision and accuracy that is comparable to that of more advanced methods such as quasiparticle self-consistent GW and eigenvalue self-consistent GW. We also find that G0W0@WOT-SRSH improves the description of states deeper in the valence band manifold. Finally, we show that G0W0@WOT-SRSH significantly reduces the sensitivity of computed band gaps to ambiguities in the underlying WOT-SRSH tuning procedure.},

  abstract = {Monoclinic bismuth vanadate (m-BiVO4) is a promising indirect band gap semiconductor for photoelectrochemical water splitting, yet the characteristics of its low-lying photoexcitations, or excitons, remain poorly understood. Here, we use an ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation approach that incorporates phonon screening to compute the nature and lifetimes of the low-lying excitons of m-BiVO4. Our calculations indicate that at 0 K, the lowest-lying exciton energy exceeds the indirect band gap, enabling spontaneous dissociation into free carriers via phonon emission within picoseconds. At 300 K, both phonon emission and absorption effects reduce this timescale to only a few femtoseconds. Phonon screening also greatly reduces the binding energy of the lowest-lying exciton, leading to an optical absorption spectrum that better reproduces experimental measurements. Overall, our findings establish the general conditions under which phonon emission-driven exciton dissociation can occur in indirect gap semiconductors, and they emphasize the critical role phonon screening can play in predictive calculations of photophysical properties of complex materials.},

The adatoms can be reproducibly dropped off from the STM tip by voltage pulses, and impact tunneling into the surface by up to {$\sim$}100\texttimes. The spatial extent and magnitude of the tunneling effect are widely tunable by imaging conditions such as bias voltage, set current and photoillumination. We attribute the effect to occupation of a (+/0) charge transition level, and switching of the associated adatom-induced band bending. The effect in STM topographic images is well reproduced by transport modeling of filling and emptying rates as a function of the tip position. STM atomic contrast and tunneling spectra are in good agreement with density functional theory calculations for In adatoms. The adatom ionization effect can extend to distances greater than 50 nm away, which we attribute to the low concentration and low binding energy of the residual donors in the undoped InSb crystal. These studies demonstrate how individual atoms can be used to sensitively control current flow in nanoscale devices.},

However, the prediction of their fundamental gaps and optical properties with density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio many-body perturbation theory has been a significant challenge. Recently, a nonempirical Wannier-localized optimally tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional has been shown to accurately produce the fundamental band gaps of a wide set of semiconductors and insulators, including lead halide perovskites. Here, we apply the WOT-SRSH functional to five halide double perovskites and compare the results with those obtained from other known functionals and previous {$G$}⁡{$W$} calculations. We also use the approach as a starting point for {$G$}⁡{$W$} calculations and we compute the band structures and optical absorption spectrum for Cs2⁢AgBiBr6, using both time-dependent DFT and the {$G$}⁡{$W$}-Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. We show that the WOT-SRSH functional leads to accurate fundamental and optical band gaps, as well as optical absorption spectra, consistent with spectroscopic measurements, thereby establishing WOT-SRSH as a viable method for the accurate prediction of optoelectronic properties of halide double perovskites.},
