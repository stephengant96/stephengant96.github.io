I’m a computational condensed matter physicist at the tail end of finished my PhD at UC Berkeley with a joint appointment at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) with Professor Jeffrey Neaton.

My work focuses on the development and application of new first-principles (AKA *ab initio*) methods for investigating the excited state properties of materials. Specifically, I work with density functional theory (DFT) as well as many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) including the GW approximation and the Bethe Salpeter Equation (BSE). At the moment, I am especially fascinated by the effects of phonons on materials' electronic and optical properties.

In addition to research, I design and teach curriculum for Splash Berkeley and mentor undergraduates and early graduate students at Berkeley and LBNL. When I step away from the code, you’ll often find me hiking or climbing in the mountains and cliffs of California.
