I’m a computational materials scientist fascinated by the subtle interplay between electrons and phonons that governs a material’s optical and electronic behavior. I earned my PhD at UC Berkeley with a joint appointment at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab under Professor Jeff Neaton, and spent formative summer research exchanges at Oxford and Cambridge. Early in my career I implemented *ab initio* phonon-exchange diagrams and discovered a 40 % reduction in exciton binding energy in BiVO₄, along with phonon-mediated exciton lifetimes in indirect-gap materials—moments that cemented my passion for many-body perturbation theory.

Today I split my time between developing high-performance research software and pushing the boundaries of theory. I’m a core developer on [BerkeleyGW](https://berkeleygw.org), [Kph](https://github.com/berkeleygw/kph), and [WOT-SRSH](https://github.com/wot-srsh/wot-srsh), and I’m working on new algorithms for efficient parallel computation of phonon-assisted processes. My recent preprint on arXiv ([2504.00110](/publications/arxiv-2504.00110)) and Psi-k 2025 abstract on exciton-phonon dynamics reflect ongoing collaborations with experimental groups to validate these predictions.

In addition to research, I design and teach curriculum for Splash Berkeley and mentor undergraduates and early graduate students at Berkeley and LBNL. When I step away from the code, you’ll often find me hiking and scrambling on local trails—always chasing the next great vista.
