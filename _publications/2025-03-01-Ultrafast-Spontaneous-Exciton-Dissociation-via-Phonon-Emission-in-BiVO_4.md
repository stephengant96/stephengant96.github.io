  Monoclinic bismuth vanadate (m-BiVO$_4$) is a promising indirect band gap
  semiconductor for photoelectrochemical water splitting, yet the characteristics
  of its low-lying photoexcitations, or excitons, remain poorly understood. Here,
  we use an ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation approach that incorporates phonon
  screening to compute the nature and lifetimes of the low-lying excitons of
  m-BiVO$_4$. Our calculations indicate that at 0 K, the lowest-lying exciton
  energy exceeds the indirect band gap, enabling spontaneous dissociation into
  free carriers via phonon emission within picoseconds. At 300 K, both phonon
  emission and absorption effects reduce this timescale to only a few
  femtoseconds. Phonon screening also greatly reduces the binding energy of the
  lowest-lying exciton, leading to an optical absorption spectrum that better
  reproduces experimental measurements. Overall, our findings establish the
  general conditions under which phonon emission-driven exciton dissociation can
  occur in indirect gap semiconductors, and they emphasize the critical role
  phonon screening can play in predictive calculations of photophysical properties
  of complex materials.
