  We report scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of individual adatoms
  deposited on an InSb(110) surface. The adatoms can be reproducibly dropped off
  from the STM tip by voltage pulses, and impact tunneling into the surface by up
  to $sim$100texttimes. The spatial extent and magnitude of the tunneling effect
  are widely tunable by imaging conditions such as bias voltage, set current and
  photoillumination. We attribute the effect to occupation of a (+/0) charge
  transition level, and switching of the associated adatom-induced band bending.
  The effect in STM topographic images is well reproduced by transport modeling of
  filling and emptying rates as a function of the tip position. STM atomic
  contrast and tunneling spectra are in good agreement with density functional
  theory calculations for In adatoms. The adatom ionization effect can extend to
  distances greater than 50 nm away, which we attribute to the low concentration
  and low binding energy of the residual donors in the undoped InSb crystal. These
  studies demonstrate how individual atoms can be used to sensitively control
  current flow in nanoscale devices.
