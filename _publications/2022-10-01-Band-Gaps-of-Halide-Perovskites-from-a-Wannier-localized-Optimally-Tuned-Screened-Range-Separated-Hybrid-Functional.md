abstract: |-
  The accurate prediction of the band gaps of halide perovskites within density
  functional theory is known to be challenging. The recently developed Wannier-
  localized optimally tuned screened range-separated hybrid functional was shown
  to be highly accurate for fundamental band gaps of standard semiconductors and
  insulators. This was achieved by selecting the parameters of the functional to
  satisfy an ansatz that generalizes the ionization potential theorem to the
  removal of charge from a state that corresponds to a Wannier function. Here, we
  present applications of the method to the band gaps of typical halide
  perovskites. We find a satisfyingly small formal mean absolute error of $sim$0.1
  eV with respect to experimental band gaps and very good agreement with previous
  many-body perturbation theory calculations.
