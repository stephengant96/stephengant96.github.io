  Accurate prediction of fundamental band gaps of crystalline solid-state systems
  entirely within density functional theory is a long-standing challenge. Here, we
  present a simple and inexpensive method that achieves this by means of
  nonempirical optimal tuning of the parameters of a screened range-separated
  hybrid functional. The tuning involves the enforcement of an ansatz that
  generalizes the ionization potential theorem to the removal of an electron from
  an occupied state described by a localized Wannier function in a modestly sized
  supercell calculation. The method is benchmarked against experiment for a set of
  systems ranging from narrow band-gap semiconductors to large band-gap
  insulators, spanning a range of fundamental band gaps from 0.2 to 14.2
  electronvolts (eV), and is found to yield quantitative accuracy across the
  board, with a mean absolute error of $sim$0.1 eV and a maximal error of $sim$0.2
  eV.
