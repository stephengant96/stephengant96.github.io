  The dependence of ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the GW
  approximation on the eigensystem used in calculating quasiparticle corrections
  limits this method's predictive power. Here, we investigate the accuracy of the
  recently developed Wannier-localized optimally tuned screened range-separated
  hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional as a generalized Kohn-Sham starting point for
  single-shot GW (G0W0) calculations for a range of semiconductors and insulators.
  Comparison to calculations based on well-established functionals, namely, PBE,
  PBE0, and HSE, as well as to self-consistent GW schemes and to experiment, shows
  that band gaps computed via G0W0@WOT-SRSH have a level of precision and accuracy
  that is comparable to that of more advanced methods such as quasiparticle self-
  consistent GW and eigenvalue self-consistent GW. We also find that G0W0@WOT-SRSH
  improves the description of states deeper in the valence band manifold. Finally,
  we show that G0W0@WOT-SRSH significantly reduces the sensitivity of computed
  band gaps to ambiguities in the underlying WOT-SRSH tuning procedure.
