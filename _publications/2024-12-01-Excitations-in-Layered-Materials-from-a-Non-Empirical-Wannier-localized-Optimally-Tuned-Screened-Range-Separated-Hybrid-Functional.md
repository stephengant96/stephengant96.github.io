  Accurate prediction of electronic and optical excitations in van der Waals (vdW)
  materials is a long-standing challenge for density functional theory. The recent
  Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH)
  functional has proven successful in non-empirical determination of electronic
  band gaps and optical absorption spectra for covalent and ionic crystals.
  However, for vdW materials the tuning of the material- and structure-dependent
  functional parameters has only been attained semi-empirically. Here, we present
  a non-empirical WOT-SRSH approach applicable to vdW materials, with the optimal
  functional parameters transferable between monolayer and bulk. We apply this
  methodology to prototypical vdW materials: black phosphorus, molybdenum
  disulfide, and hexagonal boron nitride (in the latter case including zero-point
  renormalization). We show that the WOT-SRSH approach consistently achieves
  accuracy levels comparable to experiments and many-body perturbation theory
  (MBPT) calculations for band structures and optical absorption spectra, both on
  its own and as an optimal starting point for MBPT calculations.
