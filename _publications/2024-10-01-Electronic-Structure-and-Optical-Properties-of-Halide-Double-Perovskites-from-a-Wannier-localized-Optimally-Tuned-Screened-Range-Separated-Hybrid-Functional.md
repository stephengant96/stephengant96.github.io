  Halide double perovskites are a chemically diverse and growing class of compound
  semiconductors that are promising for optoelectronic applications. However, the
  prediction of their fundamental gaps and optical properties with density
  functional theory (DFT) and ab initio many-body perturbation theory has been a
  significant challenge. Recently, a nonempirical Wannier-localized optimally
  tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional has been shown to
  accurately produce the fundamental band gaps of a wide set of semiconductors and
  insulators, including lead halide perovskites. Here, we apply the WOT-SRSH
  functional to five halide double perovskites and compare the results with those
  obtained from other known functionals and previous $G$⁡$W$ calculations. We also
  use the approach as a starting point for $G$⁡$W$ calculations and we compute the
  band structures and optical absorption spectrum for Cs2⁢AgBiBr6, using both
  time-dependent DFT and the $G$⁡$W$-Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. We show
  that the WOT-SRSH functional leads to accurate fundamental and optical band
  gaps, as well as optical absorption spectra, consistent with spectroscopic
  measurements, thereby establishing WOT-SRSH as a viable method for the accurate
  prediction of optoelectronic properties of halide double perovskites.
