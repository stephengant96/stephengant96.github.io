  We introduce an automated workflow for generating non-empirical Wannier-
  localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH)
  functionals. WOT-SRSH functionals have been shown to yield highly accurate
  fundamental band gaps, band structures, and optical spectra for bulk and 2D
  semiconductors and insulators. Our workflow automatically and efficiently
  determines the WOT-SRSH functional parameters for a given crystal structure and
  composition, approximately enforcing the correct screened long-range Coulomb
  interaction and an ionization potential ansatz. In contrast to previous manual
  tuning approaches, our tuning procedure relies on a new search algorithm that
  only requires a few hybrid functional calculations with minimal user input. We
  demonstrate our workflow on 23 previously studied semiconductors and insulators,
  reporting the same high level of accuracy. By automating the tuning process and
  improving its computational efficiency, the approach outlined here enables
  applications of the WOT-SRSH functional to compute spectroscopic and
  optoelectronic properties for a wide range of materials.
