abstract: |-
  Using both time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the ``single-
  shot'' GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) approach, we compute optical
  band gaps and optical absorption spectra from first principles for eight common
  binary and ternary closed-shell metal oxides (MgO, Al2O3, CaO, TiO2, Cu2O, ZnO,
  BaSnO3, and BiVO4), based on the nonempirical Wannier-localization-based,
  optimally tuned, screened range-separated hybrid functional. Overall, we find
  excellent agreement between our TDDFT and GW-BSE results and experiment, with a
  mean absolute error smaller than 0.4 eV, including for Cu2O and ZnO that are
  traditionally considered to be challenging for both methods.
