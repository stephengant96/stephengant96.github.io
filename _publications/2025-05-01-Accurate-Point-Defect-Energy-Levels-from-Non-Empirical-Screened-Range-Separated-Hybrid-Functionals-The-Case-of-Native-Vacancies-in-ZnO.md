abstract: |-
  We use density functional theory (DFT) with non-empirically tuned screened
  range-separated hybrid (SRSH) functionals to calculate the electronic properties
  of native zinc and oxygen vacancy point defects in ZnO, and we predict their
  defect levels for thermal and optical transitions in excellent agreement with
  available experiments and prior calculations that use empirical hybrid
  functionals. The ability of this non-empirical first-principles framework to
  accurately predict quantities of relevance to both bulk- and defect-level
  spectroscopy enables high-accuracy DFT calculations with non-empirical hybrid
  functionals for defect physics, at a reduced computational cost.
